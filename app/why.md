# Why need RStore

As we know, there are so many state-management project for React, like `Redux`、`zustand`、`mbox`、`Flux` and so on. why we need another one? will, let us think, `Vue` and `React` have a huge of ecology for they own, so do we have a way to use them all in one project without any hacker logic? so this project try to give a way to deal with this. for now this is not a stable project and the api has not finish yet, will have more think for this, welcome to work on it if anyone have a idea.
